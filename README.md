# Transit Systems of the World
=============================

## Kaggle version

The Kaggle-version dataset can be reached [here](https://www.kaggle.com/citylines/city-lines).

### Context

What did the expansion of the London Underground, the worldâ€™s first underground railway which opened in 1863, look like? What about the transportation system in your home city? Citylines collects data on transportation lines across the world so you can answer questions like these and more.

### Metadata

This dataset, originally shared and updated [source](https://www.citylines.co/data), includes transportation line data from a number of cities from around the world including London, Berlin, Mexico City, Barcelona, Washington D.C., and others covering many thousands of kilometers of lines.

### License

For this article, I used the datasets obtained from the original source on citylines.co.

## Content of the article

I suppose to show figures regarding the transit systems of the world. The R language is written here in a RMarkdown file. I published the article on Kaggle [here]()'not published yet'. And a shiny webdashboard also will be published, but it is still in progress. I will publish such a dashboard [here](utomoreza.shinyapps.io/TransitSystems)'not published yet'.

I hope you will get meaningful insights from the figures of the article and dashboard.
